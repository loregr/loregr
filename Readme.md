### 📱 Mobile Experience
My first approach to mobile development was in 2011 when I built my first Android app in Java. I got so passionate about the
mobile world that few months later I developed my first iOS app in Obj-C. Since then, I always wanted to stay updated with the
cutting edge technologies, so I studied Swift (2014) and Kotlin (2016). In 2018 I decided to put my focus on Flutter and started
to develop apps in Dart, while always keeping an eye to the native mobile development world.
